# Kernel-PCA
This is a reseach project I did during my Masters of Statistics. The topic in exploration here is "KERNEL PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS". You can find the code in R and Python(Jupyter) that has been used to apply this method to problems pertaining to this topic. Also attached is the pdf file that talks about the topic in detail including all the theory that goes into developing this method.
